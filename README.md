# Browser based Python data acquisition APP

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to offer an easy solution for creating simple browser-based data acquisition programs using Python. Data acquisation using Python has gained wider pupularity in the scientific society recently. Compared to Labview acquasition programs, Python programs are more readable and easier to manage. However, it is still a pain to create  The program comprises of two major parts: one UI class reposible for creating browser interface and managing UI events; one state machine class for taking care of requests such as instrument configuration, acquisition, data saving, etc.
